History of the business: The people behind TheraText Solutions believe "nobody goes it alone." 

What is now TheraText has experienced adaptation over time. Initially, the business was just an idea called Physpeak. Physpeak would do medical billing and notetaking for physical therapists, particularly those in rural areas. Physpeak, pitched by co-founder Alexis, went on to win Big Idea Kearney in 2024. In early March, Alexis onboarded Klayton as a co-founder. Since then, the two have done rapid development. Klayton and Alexis are doing their best to become super nerds and program the best software possible. Throughout this time, Physpeak has shifted gears to become TheraText. 

Now, the TheraText software is catered towards psychological therapists, counselors, and rural caregivers. In short, two Nebraska Nerds have built a software named TheraText, part of TheraText Solutions. Our goal is to help therapists, counselors, and care providers with their day-to-day notetaking at an affordable price.
